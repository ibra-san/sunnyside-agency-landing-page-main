## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React JS - Hooks
- SCSS
- Flexbo


### What I learned

- This project gave me a very good idea on how to use ReactJs, Build ReactJS application and deploy a ReactJS application. 
- In previous projects I have used SCSS as well; however, I learned from this project that SCSS is actually bundled with ReactJS in a way. All I have to do is change the file names from .CSS extension to .scss extension. Also when running npm run build, scss is going to be optimized along side the react file to creat a minified JS files and css files. 
- Organizing is one of the most important concepts I have learned from this project. The fact that I have organized my landing page into sections made styling them so much easier. The landing page was sectioned depending on its content. 
- File arrangment and management in ReactJS.
- Planning the project. Unlike the other simpler projects ( like page component projects I have made before), this one required a bit of planning. That planning before jumping straight into code, made developing the landing page much easier. From planning the number of sections on the page, to planning the class names of the individual tags. 


### Continued development

- Finding more efficient ways to style my project. 
- Look into using Grid than Flexbox in this project. 
- Enhance my documentation skills.
